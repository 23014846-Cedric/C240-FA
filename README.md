# OfferUp Coach

Practice interviews, get feedback, and draft confident salary-negotiation scripts.

Quick start

- Open this folder in VS Code.
- Install the Live Server extension (optional but recommended).
- Start Live Server (right-click `index.html` -> "Open with Live Server") or run a simple static server:

```powershell
# From the project root (Windows PowerShell)
# Start a simple Python server on port 8000
python -m http.server 8000
```

Files
- `index.html` — main UI
- `css/styles.css` — styles and color palette
- `js/app.js` — client-side interactivity (question switching, feedback, localStorage, negotiation generator)
- `.vscode/settings.json` — recommended Live Server settings
- `.gitignore` — ignores `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store`

Notes
- This is a starter scaffold. Extend feedback heuristics, add user accounts, and persist data to a backend as next steps.
